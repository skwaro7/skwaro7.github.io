				<h2>Music</h2>
				<div class="container" id="music">
					<p>I was interested in music since I was a very young child. My parents were constantly listening to old school rock bands like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Beattles, Pink Floyd and also polish ones like budka Suflera and Perfect. I remember my first ever vinyl - Za Ostatni Grosz/For the last penny by Budka Suflera. Great song. When I was a teenager I discovered The Doors and I fall in love completly, at one moment in the past was able to sing almost all songs from memory. These were the times of great rock music bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Oasis, The Cranberries. I started to play drumms in my friends band. This is where the feel of rythm comes from, wich I would find very useful in the coming years. I started organizing electronic parties somewhere around 2000. These were parties usually deep in the forest, by the lake, where only invited people could come. Later on I started dj'ing myself and been doing this mostly for fun for the previous 15 years. I have been to many festivals, both rock and electronic music, such as: Love Parade, Mayday, Sunrise, Electric Kingdom, Open Er, Exit Festival, Woodstock, Rock am Ring.

			            <p>I just love to travel. When I was about 15 years old my parents took me and my brother for a holiday to Spain and Morocco. It was my first trip far away and I still remember it. After that I visited UK, France, Holland, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Hungary, Greece, Montenegro, Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, USA, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and still want to see more! ;)
